    challenge: "Lost Coast Signs & Swag faced a common business challenge: how to help potential customers visualize their ideas instantly. They needed a way to bridge the gap between a client's concept and a tangible design, and more importantly, to capture these high-intent prospects as actionable leads before they lost interest.",
    solution: "99agents.agency delivered a two-part solution to convert website visitors into qualified leads. First, we executed a complete redesign of the lostcoastsigns.com website for a modern, high-performance user experience. Second, we developed and integrated the 'creAItive tool,' a bespoke AI concept generator that gives users an instant visual of their idea, capturing their information at the moment of peak interest and funneling them directly to the sales team.",
    techSpotlight: "This project's success is built on a modern, interconnected technology stack designed for intelligence, automation, and reliability.\n\nCloud & AI Infrastructure: The entire application is hosted on Google Cloud for enterprise-grade security and scalability. We utilized Google's Vertex AI platform to deploy, manage, and scale the machine learning models that power the core tool.\n\nCore Generative AI Model: The visual concepts are generated by Google's Gemini model, fine-tuned with our proprietary 'Nano Banana' implementation to ensure outputs are highly relevant to the custom sign and apparel industry.\n\nLead Management & Client Dashboard: We used Airtable to create a simple, powerful backend for the client. It acts as a real-time CRM, allowing the sales team to instantly view new concepts and lead information in an organized, actionable format.\n\nAutomated Communications: The SendGrid API is integrated to handle all transactional emails, ensuring instant and reliable notifications for both the sales team and the new prospective customer.",
    results: "The combination of a modern website and the 'creAItive tool' is a powerful lead-generation funnel. This has led to significantly improved conversion rates and a faster sales cycle, as the initial design consultation is effectively automated. The tool provides the sales team with a strong, visual starting point, making the first contact more productive and client-focused.",
